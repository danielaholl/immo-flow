-- SQL Script to create a test user in Supabase with confirmed email
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor: https://supabase.com/dashboard → SQL Editor

-- Create test user with confirmed email
-- Email: demo@immoflow.de
-- Password: Demo1234!

-- Note: You need to replace 'YOUR_PROJECT_REF' with your actual project reference
-- and generate a proper password hash

-- This is a simplified version - in production you should use Supabase's auth.users table
-- For development, it's easier to disable email confirmation as shown in Option 1 above
